<h1>Welcome to the usage study</h1>
Thank you for your interest in our study. In this study, we explore ways to recommend content to the subject where all the processing is done local to their respective machines.

<h2>How can I participate?</h2>

To participate, you should be at least 18 years of age, have an Android mobile phone(with chrome installed), have either of Windows/Mac machine(with chrome installed).

<p>If you agree to take part in this study, you need to register with a user name and a email address. You will then need to,

</p><p>1. Download and install our tool on your mobile phone and your personal computer. </p>
<p> 2. Read and sign the <a href="./consent.html">consent form</a> </p>

<p>All of this will take less than 10 minutes of your time. </p>

<p><b> For downloads:</b>: Go to <a href="./download.html">downloads</a>. </p>



<h2>How will this study benefit me?</h2>

<p>We don't have any monetary benefits for you. However, feel free to bask in the glory of having helped some research work. </p>


<h2> What are my risks? </h2>

We have made every effort to minimize your risks in participating in this study.
<p> 1. No personally identifable information is logged. This includes your phone number, IMEI number, IP address etc </p>
<p> 2. No human would look at subject's data. Recommendations are done purely by our machine
    algorithm. </p>
<p> 3. Humans(researchers) would only look at the feedback given by subject for the recommendations. As all subjects would have their own unique userids, therefore even  after looking at their feedback one may not ascertain that who was the one behind the feedback. </p>
<p> 4. Facebook, Twitter is accessed through their official android sdk, and Gmail account information is all stored locally, and never sent to 
    the server. </p>
<p>5. Our recommender system runs directly on the subject laptops itself which sends the recommendation to their mobile through our server.</p>
    
<p>6. You can stop participating in the study at any time and request that all data collected from your device be removed </p>

<p>7. All information sent to the server is sent anonymously, meaning it cannot be traced back to you or your device.</p>

<p>8. The study server is password protected and only the study researchers can access this information</p>
<p>This study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB). </p>

<h2> How is the anonymization done? </h2>

Each subject would choose their own separate username at the time of installation of the application. We would have no idea about the actual person behind that username. Username can be a3x8 etc. Thus, subjects should register with an username which doesn't leave any clue for their identification. 

<h2> How can I withdraw from the study? </h2>
You can withdraw from the study at any time. Please go to the <a href="./uninstall.html">uninstall</a> page for more details.
