This page provides a copy of the consent form associated with this study. When you install the  application, you will be required to review and agree to the contents of the form. The application will only be activated if you sign the consent form. 
</span>
<br><br>

<p>1. WHAT IS THIS FORM?</p>

<p>This form is called a Consent Form. It will give you information about the study so you can make an informed decision about participating in this research study.</p>

<p>2. WHO IS ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE?</p>

<p>To participate, you should be at least 18 years of age and have an Android mobile phone and a Mac/Windows computer with a Chrome web browser.) </p>

<p>3. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY?</p>

<p>The purpose of this research study is to recommend content to the user where all the processing is done in private, or locally</p>

<p>During the day and age of apps like Siri, Google Now etc. Giving proper suggestions to the subject by curating their data is likely to be the next big thing. However, there is always a concern for privacy with these recommendation systems. In order to solve the issue, our system does all the processing local to the subject system. No data is stored at the server. Our goal in this study is to find a heuristic which can best utilize the subject data for recommendations, and is scalable enough so that data processing at subject system is fast enough for the recommendations.</p>

<p>4. WHERE WILL THE STUDY TAKE PLACE?</p>

<p>The data will be collected on your own phone/computer and will be periodically uploaded to our server.  </p>

<p>5. WHAT WILL I BE ASKED TO DO?</p>

<p>If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to do the following: <br><br> 1. Download and install the application on your mobile phone and  on your personal computer.<br><br> 2. Read and sign this consent form. <br>
<br>
Both of the above steps will take less than 10 minutes of your time. <br><br>
3. You also have to give your feedback to our recommendations on a daily basis. <br>
    a. Recommendations would pop up on an hourly basis on your mobile, 3 hour basis on your personal computer. <br>
    b. Click on the content you like the most first to give it a rank 1. Another click would give the next content rank 2 and so on. There would be 15-20 news articles to rate everyday. <br>
    c. Just give 5 minutes of your time everyday, and you just need to give your feedback on either of mobile/personal computer. It is not necessary to give your feedback on both mobile and personal computer</p>

<p>6. CAN I STOP BEING IN THE STUDY?</p>

<p>You do not have to be in this study if you do not want to. If you agree to be in the study, but later change your mind, you may drop out at any time by uninstalling the application. In addition, you can erase all your data that was collected during the course of the study.

</p><p>7. WILL YOU COLLECT ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION OR SENSITIVE INFORMATION DURING THE STUDY?</p>

<p>This study does not log any personally identifiable information including phone number, IMEI number, personal contacts, etc. All sensitive data (such as web search URL) will be anonymized. Following are specifically recorded: <br>
a. We record the broswer history and their time stamps from mobile/personal computer. <br>
b. Social networking feeds like facebook, twitter etc. <br>
c. Description about applications installed on their android phone. <br>
d. Gmail username and password, but this would only be stored locally at subject's personal computer <br>
e. Anonymized subject location at specific times of the day.    </p>

<p> 8. WILL I RECEIVE ANY PAYMENT FOR TAKING PART IN THE STUDY? </p>

<p>We don't have any monetary benefits for you. However, feel free to bask in the glory of having helped some research work. 

</p><p> 9. WHAT ARE MY RISKS? </p>

<p>We are taking several measures to ensure your risks are minimized:</p>

<p>1. No personally identifable information is logged. This includes your phone number, IMEI number, IP address etc</p>

<p> 2. No human would look at subject's data. Recommendations are done purely by our machine
    algorithm. </p>
    
<p> 3. Humans(research) would only look at the feedback given by subject for the recommendations. As all subjects would have their own unique userids, therefore even  after looking at their feedback one may not ascertain that who is actually behind the feedback. </p>
    
<p> 4. Facebook, Twitter is accessed through their official android sdk, and Gmail account information is all stored locally, and never sent to 
    the server. </p>
    
<p>5. Our recommender system runs directly on the subject laptops itself which sends the recommendation to their mobile through our server.</p>

<p>6. You can stop participating in the study at any time and request that all data collected from your device be removed </p>

<p>7. All information sent to the server is sent anonymously, meaning it cannot be traced back to you or your device.</p>

<p>8. The study server is password protected and only the study researchers can access this information</p>

 </p>

<p> 10. WILL THE COLLECTED DATA BE RELEASED? </p>
<p>With your consent, and to better serve the research community, we will release a sanitized version of the already anonymous data a year after the data is collected. To sanitize the data, we will add random noise to different pieces of information including the time stamp of when the data was collected. We <b>will not</b> release the anonymized location data. But if you do not wish for your data to be released, you can specify it as an option in the consent form. </p>

<p>11. HOW LONG WILL THE STUDY LAST?</p>

<p>Once the study starts, we will collect data from your personal computer and mobile phone for 2 months. We will provide you detailed instructions on how to uninstall the tool from your phone and personal computer after the study is completed. </p>


<p>12. WHAT IF I HAVE QUESTIONS?</p>
