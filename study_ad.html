<h1>Study Advertisement</h1>


<p><b>Intelligent assistants like Siri, Google Now, and Cortana require users to give up their data for services such as news recommendation. The problem is that users give up their privacy to get important services. To address this privacy issue, we are developing a news recommendation system called PrIA that runs completely on the user's laptop, without requiring the cloud. Building such a local news recommendation system will ensure that the user's data remains private, while the user can get various Intelligent Assistant services. </b></p>


<p>Researchers in the computer science department at the StonyBrook University invite you to participate in a user study to provide feedback on the news recommendation system. </p>


<p>To participate in the study, please visit our website <a href=http://shashankneo.github.io/web_irb/>http://shashankneo.github.io/web_irb/</a>
</p>

<p> <b> You need to be above 18 years of age, and use the Internet at least 30 minutes a day on an average. You should also have an Android phone and a Mac/Windows laptop with Google Chrome installed. </b> </p>

<p>Our study will not store any personal information about you, nor will it access any of your user data. If you have any questions, or if you are interested in participating in the study, please email Shashank Jain at the email address:sha.jain(@)cs.stonybrook.edu. Please note that confidentiality cannot be guaranteed for communication sent via e-mail.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
