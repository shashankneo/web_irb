<h1>Study Advertisement</h1>


<p><b>During the day and age of apps like Siri, Google Now etc. Giving proper suggestions to the  subject by curating their data is likely to be the next big thing. However, there is always a concern for privacy with these recommendation systems. In order to solve the issue, our system does all the processing local to the subject system. No data is stored at the server.
Help researchers to achieve the above goal (You need to be over 18 years of age, should have an Android phone, and  have a Mac/Windows computer with Chrome installed).</b></p>

<p>Researchers in the computer science department at the StonyBrook University invite you to participate in a study focused on local recommendation systems. </p>

<p>
We will not provide you with any monetary benefits other than the satisfaction of contributing to some research.</p>

<p>The study requires that you download an application on your Android phone and  on your personal computer. At the moment we only support MAC/Windows laptops and desktops.</p>

<p>The application will log browser data, social networking feeds etc.  you perform. No personally identifiable data will be recorded. This includes the mobile phone number, the phoneâ€™s device ID the contacts on the phone, etc. The data collected by the server cannot be linked to your computer or your phone. Data on the server is password protected, and can only be seen by the researchers.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, or if you are interested in participating in the study, please email Shashank Jain at the email address:sha.jain(@)cs.stonybrook.edu. Please note that confidentiality cannot be guaranteed for communication sent via e-mail.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
