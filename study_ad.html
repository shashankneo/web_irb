<h1>Study Advertisement</h1>


<p><b>Intelligent assistants like Siri, Google Now, and Cortana require users to give up their data and in-turn give up their privacy.  	
	To address this privacy issue, we are developing a news recommendation system that runs on the user's laptop, without requiring the cloud. Building such a local news recommendation system will ensure that the user's data remains private</b>. </p>


<p>Researchers in the computer science department at the StonyBrook University invite you to participate in a user study to design a better local recommendation system. </p>


<p>To participate in the study, you can <a href="../download.html" target="_parent">download</a> an application on your Android phone and on your personal computer. We request you to periodically provide feedback about the news recommendations generated by our system. At the moment we <b>only support MAC/Windows laptops and desktops</b>.</p>

<p>Our application will not store any personal information about you. If you have any questions, or if you are interested in participating in the study, please email Shashank Jain at the email address:shashank.jain(@)stonybrook.edu. Please note that confidentiality cannot be guaranteed for communication sent via e-mail.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
