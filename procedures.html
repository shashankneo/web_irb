<p>We would just go over the basic procedures involved in this user study</p>

<p>1. Go to the <a href="../download.html" target="_parent">downloads section</a>, and follow the instructions there. Specific instructions for installation are mentioned in the README file.</p>

<p>2. You need to register with a unique username and an email. You need to use the same username on both your phone and your laptop.  </p>

<p>3. You will be asked to log into Facebook and Twitter if you have accounts. You will also be asked your GMail password. Please note that the researchers will not have access to any of your Facebook, Twitter, or Gmail data.</p>

<p> 4. You will also be asked to provide a password. Once again, you need to the type the same password on the phone and your laptop. This password will be used to encrypt any data transfer between your phone and your laptop. </p>

<p>5. You will receive news recommendations periodically. Part of the news recommendation is obtained from our PrIA system, the other is from Google's news recommendation system. The recommendations will be randomized. Swipe right if you find the news relevant, and swipe left if you do not find the news relevant. Alternatively, clicking on the news article will let you read the article and mark the news as relevant.   </p>

<p> If you are logged into your Google account, then these news recommendations are already being generated for you. We only present these recommendations to you for feedback. </p>

<p>6. Your recommendation feedback will be uploaded to our server. However, the actual news article will not be uploaded. We will only receive information of the form: "The user found the news articles 1, 6, and 9, to be relevant.".  </p>

<p>7. You can opt out of user study any time you want by following the uninstalling instructions, and contacting Aruna Balasubramanian at arunab(@)cs.stonybrook.edu</p>
