<p>We would just go over the basic procedures involved in this user study</p>

<p>1) Go to the downloads section, and follow the instructions there. Specific instructions for installation are mentioned in Readme of each zip file.</p>

<p>2. Subject would need to register with a unique username on their personal computer, and
    android phone respectively. Username should be same for both the machines, and should not contain any words like the subjects name etc.</p>

<p>3. Subject would login into Facebook, Twitter using their official android Sdk. This needs to be done only once every 2 months. Subject would also need to enter their gmail account, password in their laptop once the popup comes. This would also only need to be done once.</p>

<p>4. This study does not log any personally identifiable information including phone number, IMEI number, personal contacts, etc. All sensitive data (such as web search URL) will be anonymized. Following are specifically recorded: <br>
a. We record the broswer history and their time stamps from mobile/personal computer. <br>
b. Social networking feeds like facebook, twitter etc. <br>
c. Description about applications installed on their android phone. <br>
d. Gmail username and password, but this would only be stored locally at user's personal computer <br>
e. Anonymized user location at specific times of the day.    </p>

<p>5. The data will be collected on your own phone/computer and will be periodically uploaded to our server.  </p>

<p> 6. You also have to give your feedback to our recommendations on a daily basis. <br><br>
    a. Recommendations would pop up on an hourly basis on your mobile, 3 hour basis on your personal computer. <br>
    b. Click on the content you like the most first to give it a rank 1. Another click would give the next content rank 2 and so on. There would be 15-20 news articles to rate everyday. <br>
    c. Just give 5 minutes of your time everyday, and you just need to give the above feedback on either of mobile/personal computer.</p>   
    
    <p>7. You can opt out of user study any time you want by following the uninstalling instructions, and contacting Shashank at shajain(@)cs.stonybrook.edu</p>
